That is, don't say \"In Smith et. al.  (2009) we showed that ...\". Instead, say \"Smith et. al. (2009) showed that ...\".\n- These points are only intended to remind you of some requirements.\nPlease refer to the instructions for authors\nat [http://amstat.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=uasa20&page=instructions#.VFkk7fnF_0c](http://amstat.tandfonline.com/action/authorSubmission?journalCode=uasa20&page=instructions#.VFkk7fnF_0c)\n- For more about ASA\\ style, please see [https://files.taylorandfrancis.com/asa-style-guide.pdf](https://files.taylorandfrancis.com/asa-style-guide.pdf).\n- If you have supplementary material (e.g., software, data, technical\nproofs), identify them in the section below.  In early stages of the\nsubmission process, you may be unsure what to include as supplementary\nmaterial.  Don't worry---this is something that can be worked out at later stages.\n\n## Methods {#sec-meth}\n\nDon't take any of these section titles seriously.\nThey're just for illustration.\n\n## Verifications {#sec-verify}\n\nThis section will be just long enough to illustrate what a full page of text looks like, for margins and spacing.\n\n\n:::{add-textheight=\".5in\"}\n\n@gelm:veht:2021 offer some guidance about key ideas about statistical ideas.\nOn an unrelated note, spreadsheets are important to use correctly [@brom:woo:2018].\nLog-linear models are an attractive way to model categorical data [@bish:fien:1975].\n\nThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox jumped over the lazy dog.\nThe quick brown fox
